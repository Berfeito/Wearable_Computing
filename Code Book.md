_Code Book_ (23 Aug 2022)

The code provided in the run_analysis.R script covers all the steps from downloading the data until writing a tidy table. The data was selected, organized, and presented following the requirements of the Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Reviews Assignment.


*The dataset*
  The dataset downloaded was a zip file containing the folder UCI HAR Dataset


*Assign each data to variables*
  features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns. Data collected by the accelerometer and gyroscope.

activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns. Activities (with respective codes) performed for measurements

subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column. Testing data of 9/30 volunteers

x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns. Recorded data from sensor

y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns. Activities codes

subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column. Training data of 21/30 volunteers

x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns. Recorded data from sensors

y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns. Activities codes


*Merges the training and the test sets*
  
  X (10299 rows, 561 columns): x_train and x_test are merged with rbind()

Y (10299 rows, 1 column): y_train and y_test are merged with rbind()

subject (10299 rows, 1 column): subject_train and subject_test are merged with rbind()

XY (10299 rows, 563 column) Y and X are merged with cbind()


*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement*
  
  mean_sd (10299 rows, 88 columns) is generated by selecting the columns subject, code, and the measurements containing "mean" and "standard deviation"

*Appying descriptive activity names*
  
  Codes in mean_sd were replaced with corresponding each corresponding activity name

*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names*
  
  code column in mean_sd renamed with activities
Acc replaced with Accelerometer
Gyro replaced with Gyroscope
BodyBody replaced with Body
Mag replaced with Magnitude
Column's name starting with "f" replaced with Frequency
  Columnâ€™s name starting with "t" replaced with Time

*Generate an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject*

TidyWearable (180 rows, 88 columns) is created from mean_sd, which was groups by subject and activity so that the mean of each activity could be calculated.

TidyWearable was exported as a table called TidyWearable in text (.txt) format.
